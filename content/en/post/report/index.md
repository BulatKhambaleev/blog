Laboratory work and reports on them are drawn up not according to methodological instructions, but to the requirements of GOST. It is assumed that there is a theoretical part and a research work with an addition in the form of graphs, codes when using a computer and tables with data entered before and after the experiment. Such works are not uncommon in the specialties of exact and applied sciences, psychology and psychopedagogy - participants in surveys and tests are "placed" directly in laboratory conditions.

### Scientific report

During the course of the study, all data and changes, errors and deviations of the results are recorded. This is necessary to analyze the dynamics of the purity of the experiment. For example, in a physical or biochemical experiment, some data parameters are recorded on electronic media for the convenience of laboratory work. Fixations create links to other fixations, forming a development log graph. You can revert code to a previous commit, check how files have changed from one commit to the next, and view details about where and when changes were made. Commits are identified in Git by a unique cryptographic hash of the contents of the commit. Because everything is hashed, it's impossible to make changes, lose information, or corrupt files without Git detection. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of the same file, keeping a common change history up to the version branch point and each branch's own change history. In addition, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Typically, this kind of information is stored in a change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the central repository is not required.

### Title page layout

The following are the goals and objectives. For example, if it is necessary to carry out a calculation with the initial data, tasks are written indicating the options. Below is the rationale for what the experiment is conducted and what it is designed for.


### Technical equipment

With each new experience, the conditions can change within the same work. Therefore, any technical points should be accompanied by paragraphs indicating the progress of work. For example, aggregates are first prepared, then a good ratio of chemical elements is chosen. The method and method of influence are described, the result is recorded - what happened, was discovered or noticed. All data is entered into tables.


### Results of experiments and experimental studies

The results are duplicated at the end of the research column. If theoretical aspects were given in the main part, after which the condition for starting work is given, then the student is obliged to present the final result with conclusions in the conclusion.

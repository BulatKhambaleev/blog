Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to indicate formatting in plain text while maintaining human readability as much as possible, and suitable for machine translation into advanced publishing languages.

### History

Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz. Many language ideas have been borrowed from existing text markup conventions in emails. Markdown language implementations convert Markdown text to valid, well-formed XHTML and replace left angle brackets ("<") and ampersands ("&") with the appropriate entity codes. The first implementation of Markdown was Gruber's Perl implementation, but after a while, many third-party implementations appeared. The Perl implementation is distributed under a BSD type license. Implementations of Markdown in various programming languages ​​are included (or available as a plugin) in many content management systems. Commits create links to other commits, forming a development log graph. You can revert code to a previous commit, check how files have changed from one commit to the next, and view details about where and when changes were made. Commits are identified in Git by a unique cryptographic hash of the contents of the commit. Because everything is hashed, it's impossible to make changes, lose information, or corrupt files without Git detection. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of the same file, keeping a common change history up to the version branch point and each branch's own change history. In addition, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Typically, this kind of information is stored in a change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the central repository is not required.

## Прошедшая неделя

During the past week, a lot of interesting and unexpected things happened to me.
1. I received an extension of my internship at my job for an additional three months (very happy).
2. Performed laboratory work on the disciplines "Modeling of wireless networks", "Scientific programming".
3. Continued learning German. So far, it is very difficult, but I will try and make more efforts.

See you in the next post. Bye everyone!
